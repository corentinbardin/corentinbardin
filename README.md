I hold several certifications, including ISO 27001 Lead Auditor/Lead Implementer, 27005 Lead Risk Manager, CDPO, and 22301 Lead Implementer.  
I'm passionate about protecting sensitive data and ensuring that organizations are resilient to cyber threats.

🖨️ In my free time, I'm a 3D printing enthusiast who loves bringing ideas to life, one layer at a time. 
I enjoy experimenting with different materials and designs, always seeking new ways to push the boundaries of what's possible.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦  My family is my top priority, and I cherish the time we spend together. 
Whether it's playing board games, exploring new places, or simply enjoying each other's company, I'm grateful for every moment.

🎲  I'm also a passionate gamer and board game enthusiast.  
I love the strategic challenges, the social interaction, and the immersive worlds that games can offer.  
Some of my all-time favorites include Pokémon, Zelda, and other classic titles. 

✨ In everything I do, I strive to balance creativity, technology, and family.
I believe that each enriches the other, and I'm excited to continue exploring the intersections between these passions.
